	<p><a href="./hydraulic_efficiency_graphs/response.pdf#toolbar=0">Response Function and hydraulic efficiency zones:</a> Response function showing the relationship between the ratio of the plant (Rplant) to soil(Rsoil) resistance against hydraulic efficiency. The Maximum Power Transfer is defined as the point where the ratio equals one (Rplant = Rsoil). From there, five water transport zones can be defined starting from the MPT point, assuming a 30% variance around it, defining the most efficient zone (0.412 < ηms ≤ 0.565). Other zones include potential water stress (0 < ηs ≤ 0.412), moderately
efficient (0.565 < ηmd ≤ 0.75), moderately unrestricted (0.75 < ηmu ≤ 0.89), and unrestricted water transport (0.89 < ηu ≤ 1). Each zone is colour-coded, and the same scheme is used throughout the illustrations.</p>
	<p><a href="./hydraulic_efficiency_graphs/efficiency.pdf#toolbar=0">Hydraulic Efficiency:</a> Hydraulic efficiency (top, η unitless), sap flow (middle, J, L hr−1) and volumetric water content (bottom, θ, %) for three trees with different levels of soil water and water stress. Colour bands in the top three panels correspond to the colour-coded zones shown in Figure 3.</p>
	<p><a href="./hydraulic_efficiency_graphs/meteorology.pdf#toolbar=0">Meteorology:</a> Timeseries of 10-min vapour pressure deficit (D, kPa), air temperature (TA, oC) and total precipitation (P r, mm) during the period of sap flow measurements between May and August at Harwood Forest, Northumberland. All variables were measured over the forest canopy at 32 m 	above the ground.</p>
	<p><a href="./hydraulic_efficiency_graphs/ecdf.pdf#toolbar=0">Empirical Cumulative Density Functions:</a> Empirical cumulative density functions (FC) of hydraulic efficiency (η) plotted against efficiency for the six trees with complete timeseries over the monitoring period. Colour bands correspond to the five efficiency zones</p>
	<p><a href="./hydraulic_efficiency_graphs/sapflow_radial_variability.pdf#toolbar=0">Sap flow radial variability:</a> Sap flow of the inner measurement points of the sensor (JI , L m−1) versus the outer measurement (JO, L m−1 )during the full measurement period for (a) tree 5, (b) tree 2, and (c) tree 9. Deviation from the 1:1 line shows radial variability of water movement within the xylem.	</p>
	<p><a href="./hydraulic_efficiency_graphs/ec_stand_efficiency.pdf#toolbar=0">Ecosystem hydraulic efficiency:</a> Fingerprint plot (a) and empirical cumulative density functions (b) for stand level hydraulic efficiency calculated from evapotranspiration measurements from the eddy covariance tower at Harwood Forest, Northumberland. The colour bands in panel (b) correspond to the hydraulic efficiency zones.</p>
	<p><a href="./hydraulic_efficiency_graphs/efficiency_species.pdf#toolbar=0">Biome hydraulic efficiency - SAPFLUXNET data:</a> Mean hydraulic efficiency of 75 species across 71 sites and five biomes based on the
SAPFLUXNET classification. Error bars show the standard error of the mean. Coloured points show different biomes. Colour bands correspond to the five hydraulic efficiency zones shown in Figure 3.</p>
