<p>Sitka spruce is the major conifer species in British upland forests and is predominantly managed as even-aged, single-species plantations with rotation lengths of less than 50 years using a “patch clear-felling" system. Evidence on the impact of clear-felling on the carbon, water, and energy balances of plantation forestry is sparse and extreme weather events, such as the 2018 drought that occurred across Europe, are expected to have considerable impact. We used energy balance and gas flux data from a typical mature stand and a clear-felled site on peaty-gley soil at Harwood Forest in Northumberland, UK, over 4 years to quantify the impact of clear-felling and investigate how the drought of 2018 affected these fluxes. Felling resulted in an annual <span class="math inline">\(\rm CO_{2}\)</span> source (7.05 <span class="math inline">\(\rm tC\;ha^{-1}\;yr^{-1}\)</span>) of similar magnitude in absolute terms to the mature stand sink (-7.09 <span class="math inline">\(\rm tC\;ha^{-1}\;yr^{-1}\)</span>). The source was reduced with the growth of ground vegetation, and after tree replanting two years post-felling, the site was a weak source. Felling increased reflected radiation by 92%, reduced evapotranspiration by 28% and therefore increased site wetness by 8%, while replanting and the spread of ground vegetation increased evapotranspiration by 16% on average. The warm, dry spring and summer in 2018 increased evapotranspiration and reduced net carbon uptake of the mature stand by 30% compared to the mean of the previous three years, because of a small decrease in photosynthetic uptake and a small increase in ecosystem respiration. The drought conditions also increased ecosystem losses of <span class="math inline">\(\rm CO_{2}\)</span> at the clear-felled site by 28%. The clear-fell site would have turned into a small <span class="math inline">\(\rm CO_{2}\)</span> sink in the second year after replanting, if there had not been a drought.</p>

<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>The climate is changing and increasing mean temperatures and carbon dioxide (<span class="math inline">\(\rm CO_{2}\)</span>) concentrations are affecting the carbon cycle of forests at global <span class="citation" data-cites="Beer2010">(Beer et al. 2010)</span> and regional scales <span class="citation" data-cites="Reichstein2013">(Reichstein et al. 2013)</span> by substantially altering their exchange of <span class="math inline">\(\rm CO_{2}\)</span> with the atmosphere <span class="citation" data-cites="Forkel2016">(Forkel et al. 2016)</span>. Globally, forests play an important role in mitigating climate change <span class="citation" data-cites="Luyssaert2018">(Luyssaert et al. 2018)</span>, through removing 30% per year of the anthropogenic <span class="math inline">\(\rm CO_{2}\)</span> emissions from the atmosphere <span class="citation" data-cites="LeQuere2015">(Le Quéré et al. 2015)</span>. However, forest removal contributes to an estimated 9% of the global <span class="math inline">\(\rm CO_{2}\)</span> emissions <span class="citation" data-cites="LeQuere2015">(Le Quéré et al. 2015)</span>. Furthermore, there is also the debate as to what is their impact on global radiative forcing with some suggesting that in the boreal zone, the substantial decrease in albedo with increased tree cover offsets the mitigation benefits from carbon uptake <span class="citation" data-cites="Betts2000 Bonan2008">(Betts 2000; Bonan 2008)</span>. In the temperate zone <span class="citation" data-cites="Luyssaert2014">Luyssaert et al. (2014)</span> showed that understanding the net impact of land management changes on surface temperature depends on the balance between albedo and sensible heat flux changes.</p>
<p>In the UK forests cover 3.2 <span class="math inline">\(\rm Mha\)</span> of woodlands and forests, covering 13% of the land surface <span class="citation" data-cites="ForestStatistics2019">(Forestry Commission 2019)</span>, with the UK LULUCF inventory estimating a net <span class="math inline">\(\rm CO_{2}\)</span> uptake by forests of 17 <span class="math inline">\(\rm MtCO_2\)</span> in 2014 <span class="citation" data-cites="BEIS2016">(BEIS 2016)</span>. Approximately half of the UK forest area is coniferous forests with about 50% of that area fast growing Sitka spruce (<em>Picea sitchensis</em> (Bong.) Carr.) <span class="citation" data-cites="ForestStatistics2019">(Forestry Commission 2019)</span>. About 6,809 <span class="math inline">\(\rm km^{2}\)</span> of spruce forests are on high organic carbon peaty gley and peaty podzol soils with a mean total carbon stocks of 362 <span class="math inline">\(\rm tC\;ha^{-1}\)</span>, 75% of which is found within the first 40 <span class="math inline">\(\rm cm\)</span> depth <span class="citation" data-cites="Vanguelova2013">(Vanguelova et al. 2013)</span>.These forests are commonly managed as even-aged, single-species plantations with a rotation length of commonly 40-50 years depending on wind climate, using a “patch clear-felling” harvesting system <span class="citation" data-cites="Mason2011 Matthews1989">(Mason and Perks 2011; Matthews 1989)</span> where patches of 10-30 <span class="math inline">\(\rm ha\)</span> are clear-felled and then replanted at a density of approximately 2500 trees <span class="math inline">\(\rm ha^{-1}\)</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Low1987 McIntosh1995">(Low 1987; McIntosh 1995)</span>. This high intensity management system is expected to have a large impact on the dynamics of carbon, water, and energy fluxes of these forests.</p>
<p>Several studies have aimed to quantify the impact of patch clear-felling and consequent replanting on carbon stocks and budgets <span class="citation" data-cites="Ball2007 Zerva2005a Zerva2005b Paul-Limoges2015">(Ball, Smith, and Moncrieff 2007; Zerva et al. 2005; Zerva and Mencuccini 2005; Paul-Limoges et al. 2015)</span>, and temporal variability in carbon sink-source dynamics <span class="citation" data-cites="Hargreaves2003 Jarvis2007 Jarvis2009">(Hargreaves, Milne, and Cannell 2003; Jarvis and Linder 2007; Jarvis et al. 2009)</span> and other greenhouse gases emissions <span class="citation" data-cites="Mojeremane2010 Mojeremane2012">(Mojeremane, Rees, and Mencuccini 2010, 2012)</span>. While the impact of multiple rotations on stand carbon balance was assessed through modelling <span class="citation" data-cites="Minunno2010">(Minunno et al. 2010)</span>, the model poorly represents the impact of clear-felling. Thus, there is still a considerable knowledge gap regarding the short- and long-term impact of the harvest-replant stage on carbon, energy and water fluxes in the forest management cycle <span class="citation" data-cites="Jarvis2007">(Jarvis and Linder 2007)</span>.</p>
<p>Many studies have also previously reported the energy fluxes and Bowen ratio <span class="citation" data-cites="Wilson2003 Williams2013 Amiro2006 Law2002 Grunwald2007">(Wilson et al. 2003; Williams et al. 2013; Amiro et al. 2006; Law et al. 2002; Grünwald and Bernhofer 2007)</span> or measurements of albedo <span class="citation" data-cites="Betts1997 Lutz2014">(Betts and Ball 1997; Lutz and Howarth 2014)</span> of several types of forest ecosystems, but only a few have reported the impact of clear-felling on energy fluxes and albedo <span class="citation" data-cites="Amiro2006 Korkiakoski2019 Williams2013">(Amiro et al. 2006; Korkiakoski et al. 2019; Williams et al. 2013)</span>. In Britain, only the study by <span class="citation" data-cites="Clement2004">Clement (2004)</span> has previously examined the complete carbon, water, and energy balance of Sitka spruce forest on organo-mineral soil. However, there is still a lack of evidence on the impact of clear-felling on all three aspects of intensively managed forest plantations.</p>
<p>In recent years we have also seen large variability in global and local weather patterns. In particular, drought events are having a negative effect on terrestrial ecosystems <span class="citation" data-cites="Schwalm2012 Bastos2020">(Schwalm et al. 2012; Bastos et al. 2020)</span>. In Europe in 2018 for example, a warm spring followed by an extremely dry and hot summer caused water depletion and reduction in ecosystem carbon fluxes <span class="citation" data-cites="Bastos2020">(Bastos et al. 2020)</span>. Under future climate change scenarios drought is predicted to increase both in duration and frequency <span class="citation" data-cites="Touma2015 Cook2015">(Touma et al. 2015; Cook, Ault, and Smerdon 2015)</span> and recovery to a pre-drought condition is highly dependent on climate and carbon cycle dynamics <span class="citation" data-cites="Schwalm2017">(Schwalm et al. 2017)</span>. Currently we are lacking evidence on the effect of drought at different stages in the management cycle in Sitka spruce forests.</p>
<p>The aims of this research were to quantify the impact of the clear-felling and replanting management system for upland Sitka spruce forest in Britain by comparison of carbon, water, and energy balances of a clear-fell site with a closed-canopy stand over 4 years. During the study a substantial drought occurred, which provided additional information about the sensitivity of these balances and underlying processes to drought. In this paper we ask: 1) How did clear-felling influence the <span class="math inline">\(\rm CO_{2}\)</span> source/sink dynamics in comparison to the closed-canopy stand? 2) How was the site energy and water balance affected by felling? 3) How many years are needed for the clear-fell area to turn from <span class="math inline">\(\rm CO_{2}\)</span> source to sink? 4) How did drought affect the sink/source dynamics for carbon, water, and energy at the two sites?</p>

<h2 id="flux-sites">Flux sites</h2>
<p>Two eddy covariance (EC) flux and microclimate monitoring sites were established in an extensive commercial upland conifer forest block in Harwood Forest, Northumberland, NE England: one measuring above the canopy of a mature stand and the second on a recently clear-felled stand only 2 <span class="math inline">\(\rm km\)</span> distant. Prior to clear-felling, both stands were of similar age, productivity, climatic and edaphic conditions, enabling the effect of clear-fell management to be inferred from their comparison. The soil type was peaty-gley (cambic stagnohumic gley, WRB, FAO). Mean annual temperature for a nearby location (8 <span class="math inline">\(\rm km\)</span> from the site) between 1981-2011 was 7.6 <span class="math inline">\(\rm ^{o}C\)</span> and mean annual precipitation was 904 <span class="math inline">\(\rm mm\)</span>(Met Office, UK).</p>
<h3 id="mature-forest-site">Mature forest site</h3>
<p>The mature forest site (hereafter referred to as <span class="math inline">\(\rm MS\)</span>) is in an extensive 40 <span class="math inline">\(\rm ha\)</span> area of plantation forest. The stand was planted in 1973 and is a second rotation, even-aged, mature Sitka spruce (<em>Picea sitchensis</em> (Bong.) Carr.) stand, with a yield class of 18 <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{m^3\;ha^{-1}\;yr^{-1}}\)</span> with a top height of 26 <span class="math inline">\(\rm m\)</span>, leaf area index of 5.7 and mean tree density of 1348 trees <span class="math inline">\(\rm ha^{-1}\)</span>. The site has an elevation of 290 m and a slope of 2<span class="math inline">\(^{o}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The tower was installed in the summer of 2013 and extended in 2014 to a top height of 32 <span class="math inline">\(\rm m\)</span> above ground. A modified, semi-enclosed IRGA <span class="citation" data-cites="Clement2009">(LI7500, Li-Cor Inc., Lincoln NE, USA; Clement et al. 2009)</span> with a 1.5 <span class="math inline">\(\rm m\)</span> insulated (unheated) metal intake tube and a high airflow rate fan (60 <span class="math inline">\(\rm L\;min^{-1}\)</span>, D484T, Micronel, UK), and a 3D sonic anemometer (CSAT-3, Campbell Scientific Ltd, Shepshed, Leicestershire, UK), were installed at 34 <span class="math inline">\(\rm m\)</span> height on the top of the tower, both collecting at 10 <span class="math inline">\(\rm Hz\)</span> frequency. The sonic anemometer was orientated towards the prevailing wind direction, with the IRGA intake tube placed vertically adjacent to the anemometer and shielded to prevent rain and detritus entering the enclosure. Meteorological variables including mean air temperature and humidity (HMP60, Campbell Scientific Ltd.), precipitation (RG2 rain gauge, Delta-T Devices Ltd, Burwell, Cambridge, UK), wind speed with cup anemometers (A100L2, Vector Instruments, Rhyl, UK), incoming and outgoing short and long wave radiation (CNR4, Kipp &amp; Zonen, Netherlands), photosynthetic active radiation (SKP215, Skye Instruments Ltd, Llandrindod Wells, Powys, UK) and surface wetness (SKLW 1900, Skye Instruments Ltd), were recorded every 5 seconds from the top of the tower. To calculate the <span class="math inline">\(\rm CO_{2}\)</span> storage term below the EC instruments, air was sampled in a vertical profile of eight points at 0.3, 1, 4, 8, 14, 20, 26 and 30 <span class="math inline">\(\rm m\)</span> above ground level. Samples were drawn sequentially (from base to top inlet) using a pump with 10 <span class="math inline">\(\rm L\;min^{-1}\)</span> flow rate connected to a custom-built multiplexer operated by a Raspberry Pi computer (Model B, Raspberry Pi Foundation, UK). Air sampled from each height passed to a closed-path IRGA (LI6262, Li-Cor Inc.) for measuring <span class="math inline">\(\rm CO_{2}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\rm H_{2}O\)</span> concentration. Each height was sampled for 1 minute and 40 seconds and concentrations were recorded every second, with a 13 minute measurement cycle. Additional measurements include: soil water content (CS605, Campbell Scientific Ltd) at an average depth of 0.3 <span class="math inline">\(\rm m\)</span> and soil temperature (107 probe, Campbell Scientific Ltd) at four depths (0.02, 0.1, 0.3, and 0.6 <span class="math inline">\(\rm m\)</span>); soil heat flux (HFP01, Hukseflux, Netherlands); wind speed (A100L2, Vector Instruments) and wind direction (W200P, Vector Instruments) at the eight measurement points of the <span class="math inline">\(\rm CO_{2}\)</span> profile; and below-canopy air temperature and humidity at 2.5 <span class="math inline">\(\rm m\)</span> above ground (HMP60, Campbell Scientific Ltd.). All data were logged using CR1000 and CR3000 data loggers (Campbell Scientific Ltd.). Above-canopy, downward facing hemispherical photographs (Coolpix 4300, Nikon, UK) of the canopy were recorded using a Raspberry Pi computer (Model B, Raspberry Pi Foundation, UK).</p>
<p>In June 2018 a second 10 <span class="math inline">\(\rm Hz\)</span> EC system was installed at 3 <span class="math inline">\(\rm m\)</span> height in the bole space under the canopy, 50 <span class="math inline">\(\rm m\)</span> from the main tower in a West-South-West direction. The system was equipped with an open-path IRGA (LI7500A, Li-Cor Inc.,), a 3D sonic anemometer (CSAT-3, Campbell Scientific Ltd) with an air temperature and humidity sensor (HMP60) and a net radiometer (CNR4). The sonic anemometer was also oriented towards the prevailing wind direction.</p>
<h3 id="clear-fell-site">Clear-fell site</h3>
<p>The clear-fell site (hereafter referred to as <span class="math inline">\(\rm CFS\)</span>) was established two kilometres North-East of <span class="math inline">\(\rm MS\)</span>. The site has an elevation of 280 <span class="math inline">\(\rm m\)</span> and a slope of 5<span class="math inline">\(^{o}\)</span> from the north to the south. Prior to clear-felling, the 42 <span class="math inline">\(\rm ha\)</span> area was predominately a first rotation mature Sitka spruce planted in between 1955 and 1958 on 25.9 <span class="math inline">\(\rm ha\)</span>(77% of area), with Scots pine (<em>Pinus sylvestris</em>, L.), Lodgepole pine (<em>Pinus contorta</em>, L.) and Norway spruce (<em>Picea abies</em>, L.) on 3.2, 3.1 and 1.6 <span class="math inline">\(\rm ha\)</span>, respectively, and the remainder (8.2 <span class="math inline">\(\rm ha\)</span>) open ground areas. Yield class ranged between 12 and 18 <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{m^3\;ha^{-1}\;yr^{-1}}\)</span> and the number of stems between 934 and 2000 <span class="math inline">\(\rm ha^{-1}\)</span>. The main stand of interest was planted in 1958 and had a yield class of 16 <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{m^3\;ha^{-1}\;yr^{-1}}\)</span> and density of 1375 trees <span class="math inline">\(\rm ha^{-1}\)</span>. Felling started in late January 2015 and was completed by early March 2015. Operations followed the standard practice of the Forestry Commission <span class="citation" data-cites="Murgatroyd2005">(Murgatroyd and Saunders 2005)</span> and only large timber (<span class="math inline">\(&gt;\)</span> 7 <span class="math inline">\(\rm cm\)</span> diameter) was removed from site. Tree tops, branches and needles were left on site in rows with some used as brash-mats to prevent soil compaction from the harvesting machinery. In February 2017 replanting with 2-year old seedlings across the footprint of the tower began after ground preparation (by excavator mounding and ancillary drainage ditch maintenance). Initially after felling the ground surface was only covered with the litter layers from the previous stand and woody brash rows, but over the 4 years of measurements ground vegetation of grasses, sedges, rushes, and additional naturally regenerating spruce seedlings slowly recolonised most areas.</p>
<p>A 6 <span class="math inline">\(\rm m\)</span> tower (Gigalite 4, Lite Structures Ltd., Pontefract, UK) was installed in June 2015. The tower was instrumented with a second semi-enclosed modified IRGA and a CSAT-3 3D sonic anemometer collecting data at 10 <span class="math inline">\(\rm Hz\)</span>. The installation of the IRGA was similar to that of the <span class="math inline">\(\rm MS\)</span> tower, but with the IRGA tube intake on the west side of the anemometer centre aligned to the prevailing wind. The same type of instruments and data loggers were used as detailed for the <span class="math inline">\(\rm MS\)</span>.</p>
<p>In addition, an independent automatic weather station was set up 100 <span class="math inline">\(\rm m\)</span> north of the tower recording all basic meteorological information including mean air temperature and humidity (HC2S3, Campbell Scientific Ltd.) at 2 <span class="math inline">\(\rm m\)</span>, precipitation (ARG100, Campbell Scientific Ltd), incoming and outgoing total solar radiation (CMP3, Kipp &amp; Zonen), wind speed and wind direction from a two-dimensional sonic anemometer (Windsonic, Gill Instruments, Lymington, Hampshire, UK) and soil temperature at 0.02, 0.3 and 0.6 <span class="math inline">\(\rm m\)</span> depth (107 probe, Campbell Scientific, USA).</p>
<p>There are three adjacent tree stands within 500 <span class="math inline">\(\rm m\)</span> of the <span class="math inline">\(\rm CFS\)</span>, two with young Sitka spruce (11 years old, approximately 3.5 <span class="math inline">\(\rm m\)</span> tall at the time) on the North-West and North side and a Scots pine stand approximately 18 <span class="math inline">\(\rm m\)</span> tall to the South-East of the tower. However, the majority of the clear-felled area is to the South-West of the tower and in the predominant wind direction.</p>
<h2 id="data-processing-and-flux-calculations">Data processing and flux calculations</h2>
<h3 id="turbulent-flux">Turbulent flux</h3>
<p>Half-hourly fluxes of sensible and latent heat, momentum, carbon dioxide and water vapour were calculated from the high frequency data using EddyPro v5.2 (LiCor Inc.). Meteorological data were also averaged for each half hour and used for corrections of the calculated fluxes. Sonic anemometer velocity coordinates were corrected for tilt using the planar fit using the method of <span class="citation" data-cites="Wilczak2001">Wilczak, Oncley, and Stage (2001)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(\rm MS\)</span> and double rotation for <span class="math inline">\(\rm CFS\)</span>. To calculate the rotation matrices, two sectors were used with a -15<span class="math inline">\(^{o}\)</span> offset from the North; one of 140<span class="math inline">\(^{o}\)</span> towards the prevailing wind and one of 220<span class="math inline">\(^{o}\)</span>. The first sector therefore included mainly data from the side of the tower where the structure did not obstruct the airflow while the second sector contained the remaining. Two years of data were used for the calculations. Turbulent fluctuations were corrected using a block average de-trending algorithm. Fluxes were corrected for density fluctuations using WPL correction <span class="citation" data-cites="Webb1980">(Webb, Pearman, and Leuning 1980)</span>. Spectral corrections were also applied to calculated half-hourly fluxes for low and high frequencies using the analytical methods of <span class="citation" data-cites="Moncrieff1997">Moncrieff et al. (1997)</span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="Moncrieff2004">Moncrieff et al. (2004)</span>, respectively. Time-lag compensation correction was applied using the “covariance maximisation with default” option. The default time-lag was calculated based on the length of the sampling tube (1.5 <span class="math inline">\(\rm m\)</span>) and the airflow rate of the fan. After processing and corrections, the quality of the fluxes was flagged using the <span class="citation" data-cites="Mauder2004">Mauder and Foken (2004)</span> three class system. Air temperature, net radiation, and photosynthetic photon flux density were gap-filled before processing of fluxes, using data from the independent automatic weather station.</p>
<h3 id="rm-co_2-storage-flux"><span class="math inline">\(\rm CO_{2}\)</span> storage flux</h3>
<p>Net ecosystem exchange at the <span class="math inline">\(\rm CFS\)</span> consisted only of turbulent flux as the storage below the EC instruments was assumed negligible. At the mature stand the storage flux was calculated from <span class="math inline">\(\rm CO_{2}\)</span> concentrations measured sequentially at different heights below and through the canopy at 1 second frequency. Values were averaged for every 1 minute and 40 seconds for each measurement height. Because of the sequential nature of measurements and the 13 minute cycle between the bottom and the top measurement, mixing ratio was not available for all heights at the beginning and end of each 30 minute period. To address this issue, we implemented the methodology described by <span class="citation" data-cites="Yang2007">Yang et al. (2007)</span> to derive a pure interpolation of data between available measurements (Equation<a href="#eq:storage" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="eq:storage">[eq:storage]</a>).</p>

<p>For each 30 minute period the storage flux (<span class="math inline">\(F_{s}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\rm\mu mol\,CO_{2}\;\allowbreak m^{-2}\;s^{-1}\)</span>) was calculated as the difference in <span class="math inline">\(\rm CO_{2}\)</span> mixing ratio multiplied by the depth of each layer (<span class="math inline">\(h\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\rm m\)</span>), where <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> is the height (<span class="math inline">\(\rm m\)</span>) of the measurement point, which was the centre of the layer, <span class="math inline">\(\overline{\rho(h)}\)</span> is the mean air density (<span class="math inline">\(\rm kPa\)</span>) across measurement layer and <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is time.

<h3 id="canopy-decoupling-and-flux-correction">Canopy decoupling and flux correction</h3>
<p>Preliminary data analysis from the <span class="math inline">\(\rm MS\)</span> suggested an overestimation of net <span class="math inline">\(\rm CO_{2}\)</span> fluxes compared with available published literature. <span class="citation" data-cites="Thomas2013">Thomas et al. (2013)</span> previously had found a strong canopy decoupling effect in a high leaf area index Douglas fir stand causing an overestimation of net ecosystem exchange by instruments above the canopy. Decoupling of fluxes at different heights occurs when the fluxes measured above the canopy do not include <span class="math inline">\(\rm CO_{2}\)</span> fluxes below the canopy due to lateral air movement and different airflow below and above the canopy caused by the high leaf area and large <span class="math inline">\(\rm CO_{2}\)</span> gradient <span class="citation" data-cites="Jocher2017 Jocher2018 Thomas2013">(Jocher et al. 2017, 2018; Thomas et al. 2013)</span>. This is likely to overestimate net <span class="math inline">\(\rm CO_{2}\)</span> uptake as respiratory effluxes from soil and stems will not be correctly captured. To investigate if canopy decoupling was occurring in the mature stand, we used data from the sub-canopy EC system collected between June 2018 and February 2019 and examined wind directions above and below the canopy. Evidence of decoupling was found (see results section) and hence measured net fluxes needed correction when this occurred. We followed the methodology described by <span class="citation" data-cites="Thomas2013">Thomas et al. (2013)</span> and further expanded by <span class="citation" data-cites="Jocher2017 Jocher2018">Jocher et al. (2017, 2018)</span>. To identify these periods, we examined the relationship between the log of the standard deviation of the vertical wind velocity from the below- (<span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{w_{bottom}}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\rm m\;s^{-1}\)</span>) and above- (<span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{w_{top}}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\rm m\;s^{-1}\)</span>) canopy sonic anemometers. When the canopy is fully coupled the relationship is linear, with a break-point when flow changes from fully coupled to decoupled <span class="citation" data-cites="Thomas2013">(Thomas et al. 2013)</span>. Half-hourly values of <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{w_{top}}\)</span> were binned and the mean value of <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{w_{bottom}}\)</span> was calculated for each bin. To account for stable conditions during night-time, we split the data into day and night based on a 20 <span class="math inline">\(\rm W\;m^{-2}\)</span> threshold of global incoming shortwave radiation <span class="citation" data-cites="Ruppert2006">(Ruppert et al. 2006)</span>. To identify the break point of the linear relationship between <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{w_{bottom}}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{w_{top}}\)</span> in a statistical rather than a visual manner, two linear regressions were fitted to the binned data; one using point <span class="math inline">\([1,k]\)</span> and second from point <span class="math inline">\([k,n_{tot}]\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(n_{tot}\)</span> is the total number of bins and <span class="math inline">\(k\in{1,n_{tot}}\)</span>. The process was repeated for <span class="math inline">\(n_{tot}-1\)</span> times with <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> increasing in steps of one and for each iteration the root mean square error of each regression was calculated. The threshold (<span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{w_{th}}\)</span>) was selected as the point at which the sum of the root mean square errors of the two regressions was at its minimum. The process was repeated separately for day and night data. Net ecosystem exchange was then calculated using Equation<a href="#eq:nee" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="eq:nee">[eq:nee]</a>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[NEE =

    \sigma_{w_{th}}
  \end{cases}
  \label{eq:nee}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(NEE\)</span>(<span class="math inline">\(\rm\mu mol\,CO_{2}\;\allowbreak m^{-2}\;s^{-1}\)</span>) is the net ecosystem exchange, <span class="math inline">\(F_{CO2}\)</span>(<span class="math inline">\(\rm\mu mol\,CO_{2}\;\allowbreak m^{-2}\;s^{-1}\)</span>) is the turbulent flux, <span class="math inline">\(F_{s}\)</span>(<span class="math inline">\(\rm\mu mol\,CO_{2}\;\allowbreak m^{-2}\;s^{-1}\)</span>) is the storage flux and <span class="math inline">\(R_{e_{sub}}\)</span>(<span class="math inline">\(\rm\mu mol\,CO_{2}\;\allowbreak m^{-2}\;s^{-1}\)</span>) is the ecosystem respiration of the sub-canopy. Because of the high stem density and leaf area index of the stand, there was no under-story vegetation and so gross primary production of the sub-canopy was assumed negligible.</p>
<p>To calculate <span class="math inline">\(R_{e_{sub}}\)</span> we used the modified relaxed eddy accumulation (REA) method proposed by <span class="citation" data-cites="Thomas2008">Thomas et al. (2008)</span> which is based on the traditional representation of REA but using high frequency measurements. In addition, measurements of water vapour density perturbations provide an additional identifier for up-drafts that are enriched both in <span class="math inline">\(\rm CO_{2}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\rm H_{2}O\)</span> from other up-draft events. Raw EC data in each half-hour period were split into 6 minute intervals and ecosystem respiration was calculated using the formulae given by <span class="citation" data-cites="Thomas2008">Thomas et al. (2008)</span>. Half-hour <span class="math inline">\(R_{e_{sub}}\)</span> was calculated as the sum of all 6 minute intervals. Spikes due to either instrument noise or rain blocking the IRGA mirror were removed manually.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[R_{e_{sub}}=R_{10} \times e^{E_0\times\Big(\dfrac{1}{283.15-T_0}-\dfrac{1}{T-T_0}\bigg)}
  \label{eq:Arrhenius}\]</span></p>
<p>To gap-fill years with no sub-canopy EC data available, we used an Arrhenius type model to estimate <span class="math inline">\(R_{e_{sub}}\)</span> using below-canopy air temperature as originally proposed for modelling soil respiration by <span class="citation" data-cites="Lloyd1994">Lloyd and Taylor (1994)</span>. Data were binned into 124 temperature bins based on the range of values, and mean <span class="math inline">\(R_{e_{sub}}\)</span> and air temperature below the canopy was calculated for each bin. The model of Equation<a href="#eq:Arrhenius" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="eq:Arrhenius">[eq:Arrhenius]</a> was fitted to the binned data, where <span class="math inline">\(R_{10}\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(\rm\mu mol\,CO_{2}\;\allowbreak m^{-2}\;s^{-1}\)</span>) is the respiration rate at 10 <span class="math inline">\(\rm ^{o}C\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(E_{0}\)</span> is the activation energy (308.56 <span class="math inline">\(\rm K\)</span>), <span class="math inline">\(T_{0}\)</span> is a reference temperature (227.13 <span class="math inline">\(\rm K\)</span>) and <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(\rm K\)</span>) is the air temperature.</p>
<h2 id="quality-checks-filtering-and-gap-filling">Quality checks, filtering and gap-filling</h2>
<p>Half-hourly turbulent fluxes were manually cleaned for periods when there was a sensor malfunction or values were considered biologically implausible. Then, storage flux and below-canopy ecosystem respiration were added to the turbulent flux. Subsequently, we removed all half-hourly carbon and energy fluxes flagged as QC=2 by the <span class="citation" data-cites="Mauder2004">Mauder and Foken (2004)</span> method. We then removed spikes of both carbon and energy fluxes using a two-step process, part of a custom made R package <span class="citation" data-cites="Xenakis2016">(FREddyPro; Xenakis 2016)</span>. Because of the statistical nature of the de-spiking method, to account for seasonal difference in the magnitude of fluxes, data were split into three 4-month periods (January to April, May to August and September to December) with each period including data from all four years. In the first stage, data were split into night and day using a threshold of 20 <span class="math inline">\(\rm W\;m^{-2}\)</span> of global shortwave radiation <span class="citation" data-cites="Reichstein2005">(Reichstein et al. 2005)</span>. Then, the mean flux and standard deviation for day and night was calculated for each 4 month period and any half-hour exceeding three times the standard deviation was considered a spike and rejected. In the second stage, data from each of the 48 half-hours were grouped together and the 5th and 95th percentile was calculated with any half-hour outside these percentiles rejected. Data were further filtered to remove stable wind conditions using a friction velocity threshold (<span class="math inline">\(u^{*}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\rm m\;s^{-1}\)</span>) calculated using the methodology of <span class="citation" data-cites="Papale2006">Papale et al. (2006)</span> implemented in the R package “REddyProc”. Seasonal <span class="math inline">\(u^{*}\)</span> thresholds were calculated for each year to account for any trends.</p>
<p>After filtering, data were gap-filled using the method of <span class="citation" data-cites="Reichstein2005">Reichstein et al. (2005)</span> and partitioned using the method of <span class="citation" data-cites="Lasslop2010">Lasslop et al. (2010)</span>, applied using the R package “REddyProc”. In early 2017 a large gap (26 days) in the data due to instrument malfunction was not filled by the <span class="citation" data-cites="Reichstein2005">Reichstein et al. (2005)</span> method and so a regression approached was used. To gap-fill the carbon fluxes we first split the complete dataset into day-time and night-time with a global radiation threshold of 20 <span class="math inline">\(\rm W\;m^{-2}\)</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Ruppert2006">(Ruppert et al. 2006)</span>. We then further split the day-time data into 5 temperature classes and within each temperature class we binned the data into 60 radiation classes for which the median <span class="math inline">\(NEE\)</span> was calculated. A Michaelis-Menten model was then fitted (Equation<a href="#eq:lightCurve" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="eq:lightCurve">[eq:lightCurve]</a>) to the binned data against global radiation (<span class="math inline">\(R_{g}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\rm W\;m^{-2}\)</span>), with <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> being a parameter, <span class="math inline">\(Q_{sat}\)</span> the saturation point of the curve and <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> the respiration component.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[NEE=\frac{a \times Q_{sat} \times R_{g}}{Q_{sat}+a \times R_{g}}+R
  \label{eq:lightCurve}\]</span></p>
<p>For night-time periods, we binned the data into 14 classes and calculated the median before fitting the Arrhenius respiration model of Equation<a href="#eq:Arrhenius" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="eq:Arrhenius">[eq:Arrhenius]</a>. Sensible heat flux was gap-filled using the same approach as the day-time net ecosystem exchange, fitting a linear model with radiation for each temperature class. Latent heat was gap-filled similarly by fitting a linear model with binned radiation but without a further split into temperature classes. Over the 4 years, 46% of <span class="math inline">\(\rm CO_{2}\)</span>, 52% of latent heat and 35% of sensible heat half-hour values were gap-filled.</p>
<p>All quality checks, filtering and gap-filling procedures were similar for both the <span class="math inline">\(\rm MS\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\rm CFS\)</span>. However, because of the location of the <span class="math inline">\(\rm CFS\)</span> tower and to avoid contamination from any surrounding stands, a further filtering of the data for wind direction was necessary. From UAV aerial photography taken in June 2015, we geo-referenced a polar grid split in sectors of 22.5<span class="math inline">\(^{o}\)</span> from which we selected three between 210 – 270<span class="math inline">\(^{o}\)</span> that faced the extended clear-felled area without any trees. Data were gap-filled after filtering for wind direction. To complete the annual <span class="math inline">\(NEE\)</span> budget for 2015 we used the first month of measurements, which we assume was only ecosystem respiration, to build a regression model with air temperature and gap fill for missing months. Using temperature data from <span class="math inline">\(\rm MS\)</span>, fluxes were binned, and Equation<a href="#eq:Arrhenius" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="eq:Arrhenius">[eq:Arrhenius]</a> fitted. Ecosystem respiration was then calculated from the beginning of 2015 until the start of actual measurements (June 2015). To complete the timeseries of all key meteorological variables for 2015 at the <span class="math inline">\(\rm CFS\)</span>, except for evapotranspiration, we used data from the <span class="math inline">\(\rm MS\)</span>. To gap-fill evapotranspiration, we developed a linear relationship with binned global radiation from available 2015 measurements.</p>
<h2 id="soil-measurements-and-partitioning-ecosystem-respiration">Soil measurements and partitioning ecosystem respiration</h2>
<p>To partition ecosystem respiration into above-ground and soil, we conducted a series of manual surveys of total soil respiration (heterotrophic and autotrophic, <span class="math inline">\(R_{s}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\rm\mu mol\,CO_{2}\;\allowbreak m^{-2}\;s^{-1}\)</span>), using a portable IRGA with 20 cm diameter chamber (LI8100A and LI8100-103, LiCor Inc.) and permanent soil collars at both sites and calculated the soil:ecosystem respiration ratio (<span class="math inline">\(r_{R}\)</span>). Surveys took place every two weeks between 2015 and 2017 and every month in 2018, but between the end of July 2015 and end of August 2015 <span class="math inline">\(R_{s}\)</span> was measured twice a week. At each site before the first measurements we randomly located 25 plastic collars each one with a diameter of 20 cm and an offset of <span class="math inline">\(\rm \sim 5 cm\)</span> (volume <span class="math inline">\(\rm \sim 4843 cm^3\)</span>). Each collar was measured for 1 minute and 20 seconds with 20 seconds pre- and post-purge. The full set of measurements lasted 2 1/2 hours per site, conducted on the same day either side of midday and the order of sampling between sites was rotated between occasions. Fluxes for each collar were calculated fitting a linear regression between <span class="math inline">\(\rm CO_{2}\)</span> mixing ratio and time. The mean <span class="math inline">\(r_{R}\)</span> was calculated for each year by averaging the ratio of the mean soil respiration of each survey and mean ecosystem respiration during the same time. For consistency with the filtering of eddy covariance data, the ratio for the <span class="math inline">\(\rm CFS\)</span> was calculated using collars within the 210 – 270<span class="math inline">\(^{o}\)</span> wind direction. Although we calculated the ratio for each year at the <span class="math inline">\(\rm CFS\)</span>, ground vegetation colonised the collars over time, but to avoid adding bias due to soil disturbance and added root decomposition, new vegetation was not removed. For partitioning fluxes at the <span class="math inline">\(\rm CFS\)</span>, we used the 2015 <span class="math inline">\(r_{R}\)</span> value across all four years, with gap-filled ecosystem respiration from the start of 2015 to the beginning of actual measurements assumed to represent soil respiration. At the <span class="math inline">\(\rm MS\)</span> we used the ratio for each year.</p>
<h2 id="further-calculations">Further calculations</h2>
<p>We assessed the energy balance closure (<span class="math inline">\(EBC\)</span>) as the slope of the linear relationship between the sum of daily sensible heat (<span class="math inline">\(H\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\rm W\;m^{-2}\)</span>) and latent heat (<span class="math inline">\(LE\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\rm W\;m^{-2}\)</span>) versus the difference between daily net radiation (<span class="math inline">\(R_{n}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\rm W\;m^{-2}\)</span>) and soil heat flux (<span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\rm W\;m^{-2}\)</span>) using data before gap filling, but after quality control and <span class="math inline">\(u^{*}\)</span> threshold filtering. We also calculated the monthly sum of day-time energy fluxes, mean monthly Bowen ratio (<span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>, unitless) as the ratio of <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(LE\)</span>, and mean monthly albedo as the ratio of outgoing to incoming shortwave radiation (<span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>, unitless).</p>

<p>We calculated the mean monthly water use efficiency at site level by analogy to the leaf-scale ratio of photosynthesis to transpiration as the ratio of gross primary photosynthesis (<span class="math inline">\(GPP\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\rm\mu mol\,CO_{2}\;\allowbreak m^{-2}\;s^{-1}\)</span>) to total losses of water through evapotranspiration (<span class="math inline">\(ET\)</span>). However, at large scales the ratio becomes de-coupled from its immediate dependency with leaf stomatal conductance, which leads to small changes in severe droughts <span class="citation" data-cites="Reichstein2007">(Reichstein et al. 2007)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[iW_{E}=\frac{GPP\times D}{ET}

<p>As an alternative, we used the method proposed by <span class="citation" data-cites="Beer2009">Beer et al.

To reduce the contribution of soil evaporation and interception to the total <span class="math inline">\(ET\)</span>, so that <span class="math inline">\(iW_{E}\)</span> reflects more closely the photosynthetic to stomatal conductance ratio, data from rainy days and two subsequent days were excluded from the analysis.

<p>Mean monthly air temperatures were very similar between the mature stand (<span class="math inline">\(\rm MS\)</span>) and clear-fell (<span class="math inline">\(\rm CFS\)</span>) sites across all four years (Figure<a href="#fig:meteorology" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:meteorology">1</a>a). There was an increase of 2 <span class="math inline">\(\rm ^{o}C\)</span> in July and 1 <span class="math inline">\(\rm ^{o}C\)</span> in August 2018 compared to the same months of the previous three years. The winter of 2017/2018 was considerably colder than the previous years, but the mean annual temperature of 2018 was not different from the long-term mean (7.7 <span class="math inline">\(\rm ^{o}C\)</span>). Mean monthly surface soil temperatures (<span class="math inline">\(T_{sf}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\rm ^{o}C\)</span>) were similar between years and between sites for the first three years, with slightly higher values at the clear-fell site in spring and early summer. Between May and August 2018, the mean <span class="math inline">\(T_{sf}\)</span> at the <span class="math inline">\(\rm CFS\)</span> was 0.7 <span class="math inline">\(\rm ^{o}C\)</span> higher than the mean of the previous three years for the same period, but it was unchanged at the <span class="math inline">\(\rm MS\)</span>. Mean monthly precipitation (Figure<a href="#fig:meteorology" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:meteorology">1</a>c) was always higher at the <span class="math inline">\(\rm MS\)</span>, which resulted from differences in both raingauge location (atop the 32 <span class="math inline">\(\rm m\)</span> tower above the forest canopy compared to mounted on the ground) and elevation and exposure between the two sites. November 2015 to January 2016 were particularly high precipitation months with snowfalls in November of over 250 <span class="math inline">\(\rm mm\)</span> equivalent. The wettest year at the <span class="math inline">\(\rm MS\)</span> was in 2017 (1439 <span class="math inline">\(\rm mm\)</span>), whereas at the <span class="math inline">\(\rm CFS\)</span> it was in 2016 (1159 <span class="math inline">\(\rm mm\)</span>). Although the annual precipitation for 2018 was only 14% (1010 <span class="math inline">\(\rm mm\)</span>) and 12% (962 <span class="math inline">\(\rm mm\)</span>) lower than the mean for the 3 previous years at the <span class="math inline">\(\rm MS\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\rm CFS\)</span> respectively, May, June and July 2018 were drier than the previous years (lowest in May), which when associated with high photon flux densities (Figure<a href="#fig:meteorology" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:meteorology">1</a>e) because of the reduced cloud cover, produced high evapotranspiration rates leading to very dry soil conditions (Figure<a href="#fig:meteorology" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:meteorology">1</a>d). Vapour pressure deficit was also consistently higher at the <span class="math inline">\(\rm CFS\)</span> during the summer months than at the <span class="math inline">\(\rm MS\)</span> except for a small period of 3 months during spring of 2016 (Figure<a href="#fig:meteorology" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:meteorology">1</a>e).</p>

<p>The closure of the measured daily energy balance (<span class="math inline">\(EBC\)</span>) varied between years and sites (Table<a href="#tab:ebc" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="tab:ebc">[tab:ebc]</a>) although the overall four year <span class="math inline">\(EBC\)</span> was 84% at the mature stand and 91% at the clear-fell site. During the drier 2018 the <span class="math inline">\(EBC\)</span> increased at both sites (Table<a href="#tab:ebc" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="tab:ebc">[tab:ebc]</a>), which may indicate an alteration in energy balance components over the footprint. The difference in the intercept represents a difference in the systematic error of the closure between the two sites (between -13 and -21 <span class="math inline">\(\rm W\;m^{-2}\)</span> for the <span class="math inline">\(\rm MS\)</span> and 0.1 and 14 <span class="math inline">\(\rm W\;m^{-2}\)</span> for the <span class="math inline">\(\rm CFS\)</span>).</p>
<p>The seasonal cycle of mean monthly day-time net radiation was generally higher during summer at the mature site than the clear-fell (Figure<a href="#fig:energy" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:energy">6</a>a). Net radiation peaked during May-July at both the mature and clear-fell site (average peak value of 310 and 443 <span class="math inline">\(\rm W\;m^{-2}\)</span> respectively), except in 2017 at the <span class="math inline">\(\rm CFS\)</span> after re-planting, which peaked in July at 387 <span class="math inline">\(\rm W\;m^{-2}\)</span>. The difference in day-time <span class="math inline">\(R_{n}\)</span> between the two sites was higher between May and August 2018 due to a 13% higher <span class="math inline">\(R_{n}\)</span> at the <span class="math inline">\(\rm MS\)</span> compared to the mean for the same period of the previous 3 years, while <span class="math inline">\(R_{n}\)</span> at the <span class="math inline">\(\rm CFS\)</span> was almost unchanged. Mean monthly albedo (<span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>, unitless) at the <span class="math inline">\(\rm MS\)</span> was consistently around a value of 0.08. The albedo was higher at the <span class="math inline">\(\rm CFS\)</span>, between 0.14 and 0.16, although there is the possibility of an underestimation as measurements were from the automatic weather station 100 <span class="math inline">\(\rm m\)</span> north of the main tower, on an upslope location with slightly drier soil and less vegetation than the main footprint area. Between May and August 2018, <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> at the <span class="math inline">\(\rm CFS\)</span> decreased slightly (4%) from the mean of the previous three years for the same period and increased by 8% at the <span class="math inline">\(\rm MS\)</span>(Figure<a href="#fig:energy" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:energy">6</a>b). Mean monthly day-time sensible heat flux (<span class="math inline">\(Q_{H}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\rm MJ\;m^{-2}\)</span>) was similar in each year for both sites (Figure<a href="#fig:energy" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:energy">6</a>c) except from November 2015 to February 2016, where there were minima at the <span class="math inline">\(\rm MS\)</span> associated with the cold weather and snowfall, which did not occur at the <span class="math inline">\(\rm CFS\)</span>, and May 2015 and 2016 due to high net radiation (Figure<a href="#fig:energy" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:energy">6</a>a). At both sites, the monthly <span class="math inline">\(Q_{H}\)</span> during late spring and summer (MJJ) of 2018 was only slightly higher (<span class="math inline">\(\sim\)</span>20 <span class="math inline">\(\rm MJ\;m^{-2}\)</span>) than the peak of the previous three years. Mean monthly day-time latent heat (<span class="math inline">\(Q_{LE}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\rm MJ\;m^{-2}\)</span>), was low in most winter months, except for the wet period in November 2015 to December 2015 at the <span class="math inline">\(\rm MS\)</span>, while it peaked in summer (Figure<a href="#fig:energy" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:energy">6</a>d).

<p>At the <span class="math inline">\(\rm CFS\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(Q_{LE}\)</span> was usually lower than at the <span class="math inline">\(\rm MS\)</span>, except for a period of 5 months after re-planting most likely due to increased soil evaporation from soil disturbance and accumulated surface water from forestry management operations. The Bowen ratio (<span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>) varied seasonally between -2 to 3 with the minima during winter, usually between November to January, and a maximum in May (Figure<a href="#fig:energy" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:energy">6</a>e). The mean late spring-summer <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>(May-August) for the first three years was between 1.41 and 1.59 at the <span class="math inline">\(\rm MS\)</span> and 1.18 and 1.64 at the <span class="math inline">\(\rm CFS\)</span>. The dry spring and warm summer of 2018 reduced mean late spring-summer <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> by 45% at the <span class="math inline">\(\rm MS\)</span> and 17% at the <span class="math inline">\(\rm CFS\)</span> to 0.82 and 1.18 respectively. Day-time soil heat flux was a very small component of the energy balance, 3 and 6% of <span class="math inline">\(R_{n}\)</span> at the <span class="math inline">\(\rm MS\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\rm CFS\)</span> respectively, but it was always higher at the <span class="math inline">\(\rm CFS\)</span> during spring and summer (Figure<a href="#fig:energy" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:energy">6</a>d).

The exposed surface at the clear-fell site in the first year after felling resulted in a much larger diurnal cycle than under the canopy at the mature site (mean spring-summer conditions in 2016, Figure<a href="#fig:diurnal_energy" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:diurnal_energy">[fig:diurnal_energy]</a>d). During this period, the mature tree stand had slightly more long-wave loss at night than the clear-fell site (Figure<a href="#fig:diurnal_energy" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:diurnal_energy">[fig:diurnal_energy]</a>a), consequently there was slightly more sensible heat transfer to the canopy (negative <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span>, Figure<a href="#fig:diurnal_energy" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:diurnal_energy">[fig:diurnal_energy]</a>b).</p>

In the drought year of 2018, it dropped by 30% from the previous three year mean. Annual gross primary production (<span class="math inline">\(GPP\)</span>) was between 22.8 and 25.0 <span class="math inline">\(\rm tC\;ha^{-1}\;yr^{-1}\)</span> the first three years, then dropped by 5% in 2018 while <span class="math inline">\(R_{e}\)</span> was between 15.7 and 16.6 <span class="math inline">\(\rm tC\;ha^{-1}\;yr^{-1}\)</span> and then increased by 7% in 2018.

Ecosystem respiration (<span class="math inline">\(R_{e}\)</span>) at the <span class="math inline">\(\rm CFS\)</span> was substantial in all four years, (although only 49-58% of that at the <span class="math inline">\(\rm MS\)</span>) but in 2018 it was 28% higher than the mean of the previous three years. In 2015, 45% of the ecosystem respiration was from the soil at the <span class="math inline">\(\rm CFS\)</span> and we assumed the same proportion for the subsequent years in order to estimate annual <span class="math inline">\(R_{s}\)</span>, assumption which may have introduced a bias in the calculated annual totals. The drought conditions in the late spring and summer of 2018 turned the <span class="math inline">\(\rm CFS\)</span> back into a strong source equivalent to 41% of the net <span class="math inline">\(\rm CO_{2}\)</span> uptake by the <span class="math inline">\(\rm MS\)</span> in that year.</p>
<p>Figure<a href="#fig:carbon_water" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:carbon_water">[fig:carbon_water]</a> shows the time course of monthly <span class="math inline">\(NEE\)</span> at both sites and how it related to daily evapotranspiration, (<span class="math inline">\(ET\)</span>). At the <span class="math inline">\(\rm MS\)</span> the monthly <span class="math inline">\(NEE\)</span> was at a minimum (maximum net <span class="math inline">\(\rm CO_{2}\)</span> uptake) around July due to both high <span class="math inline">\(GPP\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(R_{e}\)</span>(Figure<a href="#fig:carbon_water" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:carbon_water">[fig:carbon_water]</a>a,b). <span class="math inline">\(GPP\)</span> increased rapidly from February and March as solar radiation increased, through to peak values in June-August. During the drought of 2018, <span class="math inline">\(ET\)</span> increased sharply between May and July (Figure<a href="#fig:carbon_water" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:carbon_water">[fig:carbon_water]</a>d) to 105 <span class="math inline">\(\rm mm\;d^{-1}\)</span>, leading to a large drop in <span class="math inline">\(S_{w}\)</span>(minimum of 23%, Figure<a href="#fig:meteorology" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:meteorology">1</a>d) and reduction in <span class="math inline">\(\rm CO_{2}\)</span> uptake (i.e. <span class="math inline">\(NEE\)</span> became less negative, Figure<a href="#fig:carbon_water" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:carbon_water">[fig:carbon_water]</a>c) and in <span class="math inline">\(GPP\)</span>(Figure<a href="#fig:carbon_water" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:carbon_water">[fig:carbon_water]</a>a). Although precipitation returned to more normal values from August (Figure<a href="#fig:meteorology" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:meteorology">1</a>c), <span class="math inline">\(S_{w}\)</span> did not start to increase until September and did not reach pre-drought levels by the end of the year (Figure<a href="#fig:meteorology" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:meteorology">1</a>d).</p>
<p>The monthly <span class="math inline">\(NEE\)</span> values show that the clear-fell site was a <span class="math inline">\(\rm CO_{2}\)</span> source throughout 2015 and 2016. In 2017 although the <span class="math inline">\(\rm CFS\)</span> was a net source over the whole year <span class="math inline">\(NEE\)</span> became slightly negative after April (Figure<a href="#fig:carbon_water" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:carbon_water">[fig:carbon_water]</a>c) when <span class="math inline">\(GPP\)</span> increased (Figure<a href="#fig:carbon_water" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:carbon_water">[fig:carbon_water]</a>a). In the period after the replanting operations <span class="math inline">\(ET\)</span> at the clear-fell site was slightly higher than <span class="math inline">\(ET\)</span> in the mature stand. The monthly mean <span class="math inline">\(S_{w}\)</span> was always higher at the <span class="math inline">\(\rm CFS\)</span> than the <span class="math inline">\(\rm MS\)</span> and showed only slight declines each summer, except in 2018 when the decline was more marked. There was no immediate large change in <span class="math inline">\(R_{e}\)</span> after replanting operations, but rather <span class="math inline">\(R_{e}\)</span> steadily increased as vegetation grew. The peak in <span class="math inline">\(ET\)</span> during the 2018 drought was a month later than at the <span class="math inline">\(\rm MS\)</span> but <span class="math inline">\(S_{w}\)</span> was at its lowest in July in both sites.</p>
<p>In 2015-2017, annual evapotranspiration was 25% of the annual precipitation, but in 2018 <span class="math inline">\(ET\)</span> increased by 69% at the <span class="math inline">\(\rm MS\)</span> and 36% at the <span class="math inline">\(\rm CFS\)</span> compared to the 2015-2017 mean (Table<a href="#tab:carbon_summary" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="tab:carbon_summary">[tab:carbon_summary]</a>). The drought of 2018 caused 27% of the daily <span class="math inline">\(S_{w}\)</span> values at the <span class="math inline">\(\rm MS\)</span> to drop below the minimum value of previous three years whereas at the <span class="math inline">\(\rm CFS\)</span><span class="math inline">\(S_{w}\)</span> was reduced by only 6%.</p>
<h2 id="water-use-efficiency">Water use efficiency </h2>
<p>Mean inherent water use efficiency calculated for dry days only (<span class="math inline">\(iW_{E}\)</span>) during April-July in the first three years was between 28.7 and 42.1 <span class="math inline">\(\rm gC\,\allowbreak hPa\;kgH_{2}O^{-1}\)</span> for the mature stand. Water use efficiency at the <span class="math inline">\(\rm MS\)</span> was at its lowest during winter months, and highest in July (Figure<a href="#fig:carbon_water" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:carbon_water">[fig:carbon_water]</a>e). It was high in February and March 2016 and November 2017 because of moderate rates of photosynthesis (Figure<a href="#fig:carbon_water" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:carbon_water">[fig:carbon_water]</a>a). Between March and May 2018 <span class="math inline">\(iW_{E}\)</span> decreased by 73% from the previous three year mean. The <span class="math inline">\(iW_{E}\)</span> remained very low during summer and autumn due to the low soil moisture, which did not start to recover till after September (Figure<a href="#fig:meteorology" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:meteorology">1</a>d). Calculations of <span class="math inline">\(iW_{E}\)</span> for the clear-fell site resulted in a large number of gaps, making it difficult to see seasonal patterns. However, <span class="math inline">\(iW_{E}\)</span> was predominately lower than for the <span class="math inline">\(\rm MS\)</span> as the <span class="math inline">\(GPP\)</span> was always small, and appeared to be increasing over time as <span class="math inline">\(GPP\)</span> increased. During 2018 <span class="math inline">\(iW_{E}\)</span> values for both sites were similar.</p>
<h1 id="discussion">Discussion</h1>
<h2 id="energy-balance">Energy balance</h2>
<p>Energy balance closure (<span class="math inline">\(EBC\)</span>) at the mature stand was within previously reported values for Sitka spruce stands <span class="citation" data-cites="Clement2004">(Clement 2004)</span>. The author also reported a variability between different days of the year and day/night, with <span class="math inline">\(EBC\)</span> ranging between 0.6 to 1.1. <span class="citation" data-cites="Grunwald2007">Grünwald and Bernhofer (2007)</span> also reported annual closure between 0.76 and 0.94 for Norway spruce. We found our highest <span class="math inline">\(EBC\)</span> to occur during the driest of the four years in our study, while <span class="citation" data-cites="Grunwald2007">Grünwald and Bernhofer (2007)</span> did not note a particular improvement during their drought year of 2003.</p>
<p>At the <span class="math inline">\(\rm CFS\)</span> the energy balance closure was higher than the values of 0.81 and 0.74 reported by <span class="citation" data-cites="Paul-Limoges2015">Paul-Limoges et al. (2015)</span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="Williams2013">Williams et al. (2013)</span>, respectively. <span class="citation" data-cites="Kowalski2004">Kowalski et al. (2004)</span> reported higher <span class="math inline">\(EBC\)</span> values for harvested sites which is also evident here when comparing the clear-fell to the mature stand. Energy balance closure in the first year was close to these reported values but it is likely it was overestimated as it was not measured for a complete annual cycle. The imbalance in energy exchange we found at the <span class="math inline">\(\rm MS\)</span> was similar to the 20% reported across a range of vegetation types and climates <span class="citation" data-cites="Wilson2002">(Wilson et al. 2002)</span>. The lack of energy balance closure can be influenced by instrument errors, canopy architecture, site topography <span class="citation" data-cites="Clement2004">(Clement 2004)</span> or damping of high frequency fluctuations causing underestimation of latent heat <span class="citation" data-cites="Goulden1996">(Goulden et al. 1996)</span>. At the <span class="math inline">\(\rm MS\)</span> it is likely attributable to either an underestimation of turbulent fluxes <span class="citation" data-cites="Amiro2006 Masseroni2014 Twine2000 Wilson2002">(Amiro et al. 2006; Masseroni, Corbari, and Mancini 2014; Twine et al. 2000; Wilson et al. 2002)</span> as decoupling and possible advection have reduced the energy fluxes measured at the top of the canopy or missing heat storage below and within the canopy. Another possible explanation for the lack of energy balance closure can be the different horizontal scale at which each energy component is measured <span class="citation" data-cites="Foken2008">(Foken 2008)</span>.</p>
<p>Energy balance closure improved during 2018 at both sites. <span class="citation" data-cites="Goulden1996">Goulden et al. (1996)</span> showed that for a closed path IRGA, damping of the signal at high frequencies cause a 20% reduction in evapotranspiration due to absorption and desorption on the walls of inlet tubing. Although our modified enclosed open path IRGAs were sampling air through a 1.5 m tube and although short, metal, and insulated (but not heated), it may be possible that less condensation inside the tube during the dry 2018 conditions reduced the high frequency damping and improved the estimation of latent heat and energy balance closure.</p>
<p>The systematic error of the <span class="math inline">\(EBC\)</span> represented by the intercept was found to differ between the two sites (Table<a href="#tab:ebc" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="tab:ebc">[tab:ebc]</a>). As <span class="citation" data-cites="Masseroni2014">Masseroni, Corbari, and Mancini (2014)</span> demonstrated in a study aiming to improve the energy balance closure over a maize field, the systematic error was reduced (intercept closer to zero) when unaccounted terms were included (e.g., soil heat storage, canopy heat storage and energy flux for photosynthesis). The authors also found the error was sensitive to friction velocity and vegetation height. The differences we observed between the two sites is probably a combination of storage and friction velocity. At the mature site, it is likely the dense canopy and low wind speeds created stable conditions and increased the heat storage in the stand. In determining the daily energy balance closure of the canopy, stem, bole space and soil storage component were not accounted for, although the influence on the daily <span class="math inline">\(EBC\)</span> should be small. Furthermore, energy used for photosynthesis was also not considered. Future work should aim to quantify these missing elements of the energy balance which can reduce the systematic error and improve energy balance closure <span class="citation" data-cites="Masseroni2014">(Masseroni, Corbari, and Mancini 2014)</span>. At the clear-fell site the systematic error was smaller and closer to zero. Low friction velocities and lack of any canopy heat storage is the most likely explanation for the lower error.</p>
<p>The lower day-time <span class="math inline">\(R_{n}\)</span> measured at the clear-fell site compared to the mature stand (Figure<a href="#fig:energy" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:energy">6</a> and <a href="#fig:diurnal_energy" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:diurnal_energy">[fig:diurnal_energy]</a>) was partly caused by the 5-8% higher albedo, (declining over time as ground vegetation established), but also moderated by the higher surface temperatures at the exposed <span class="math inline">\(\rm CFS\)</span>. The range of monthly surface albedo we observed at the <span class="math inline">\(\rm MS\)</span> was very close to typical measured or modelled values for boreal and northern temperate spruce stands <span class="citation" data-cites="Betts1997 Clement2004 Betts2007 Lutz2014">(0.08-0.12; Betts and Ball 1997; Clement 2004; Betts, Desjardins, and Worth 2007; Lutz and Howarth 2014)</span>. <span class="citation" data-cites="Hovi2017">Hovi, Lukeš, and Rautiainen (2017)</span> reported mean modelled albedo values of 0.08 for spruce stands in Finland with little variation from May to October as we observed. A 3% winter increase in albedo was noted at the BOREAS spruce sites <span class="citation" data-cites="Betts1997">(Betts and Ball 1997)</span> associated with snow cover on the ground, but such conditions occurred infrequently and for only short durations at our site. The albedo of the clear-fell site was close to the modelled spring/summer value of 0.16 reported by <span class="citation" data-cites="Lutz2014">Lutz and Howarth (2014)</span> for a clear-cut area in New Hampshire, N.E. USA.</p>
<p>The day-time mean <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> for the mature stand in the first three years (Figure<a href="#fig:energy" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:energy">6</a>e) was close to the mid-day values of 1.15-2 reported by <span class="citation" data-cites="Clement2004">Clement (2004)</span> for a Scottish Sitka spruce stand and 1.34 for a Norway spruce in Germany <span class="citation" data-cites="Wilson2003">(Wilson et al. 2003)</span>. <span class="citation" data-cites="Grunwald2007">Grünwald and Bernhofer (2007)</span> found lower <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> of between 0.6-0.7 for a slightly wetter but similar temperature site with older Norway spruce trees on more freely drained podzolic brown earth soil. Although a large component of the latent heat flux is dependent on the site conditions, the transpiration component depends on tree photosynthetic rates and stomatal control of water loss which are age and species dependent, which may explain the lower value of <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> observed by <span class="citation" data-cites="Grunwald2007">Grünwald and Bernhofer (2007)</span>. Drought conditions in 2018 caused <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> to drop closer to 0.7.</p>
<p>At the clear-fell site <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> was also mainly between 1 and 2, between spring and autumn. These low <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> values emphasise the cool, wet conditions at both sites, and show that the clear-fell site did not completely dry out even in the 2018 drought conditions. Only on one occasion during the warm dry May in 2016 <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> was close to 3 (Figure<a href="#fig:energy" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:energy">6</a>e). <span class="citation" data-cites="Korkiakoski2019">Korkiakoski et al. (2019)</span> also reported <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> between 1.5 and 2.5 for the first year after felling of a peatland site and between 0.5 and 1.5 for the second year. While we were not able to measure the energy balance immediately after felling, day-time <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> values in July-September were the same as the mature site.</p>
<p>The harvesting of the trees removed the very effective solar radiation absorbing surface of the conifer canopy and exposed the soil and litter surface causing an increase in albedo, approximately doubling at first (Figure<a href="#fig:energy" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:energy">6</a>), reducing the net all-wave radiation receipt (Figure<a href="#fig:energy" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:energy">6</a> and <a href="#fig:diurnal_energy" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:diurnal_energy">[fig:diurnal_energy]</a>). As vegetation cover increased, the albedo declined as expected.</p>
<h2 id="carbon-balance">Carbon balance</h2>
<p>Early analysis showed measured net <span class="math inline">\(\rm CO_{2}\)</span> uptake was overestimated compared to published values for spruce species in similar condition <span class="citation" data-cites="Baldocchi2018 Clement2012 Kowalski2004 Magnani2007 Saunders2012">(Baldocchi, Chu, and Reichstein 2018; Clement, Jarvis, and Moncrieff 2012; Kowalski et al. 2004; Magnani et al. 2007; Saunders et al. 2012)</span>. Although in many situations this can be due to night-time stable wind conditions <span class="citation" data-cites="Clement2012 Papale2006">(Clement, Jarvis, and Moncrieff 2012; Papale et al. 2006)</span>, topographic flux loss <span class="citation" data-cites="Clement2012">(Clement, Jarvis, and Moncrieff 2012)</span> or advective losses <span class="citation" data-cites="Staebler2004 Hong2008">(Staebler and Fitzjarrald 2004; Hong et al. 2008)</span>, in our case the overestimation was due to canopy decoupling (Figure<a href="#fig:decoupling" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:decoupling">4</a>). Recent studies highlight similar <span class="math inline">\(NEE\)</span> overestimation in high <span class="math inline">\(L^{*}\)</span> stands caused by a strong canopy decoupling effect <span class="citation" data-cites="Jocher2017 Jocher2018 Thomas2008 Thomas2013">(Jocher et al. 2017, 2018; Thomas et al. 2008, 2013)</span>. Our results provide additional evidence (Figure<a href="#fig:decoupling" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:decoupling">4</a>) and underpin the importance of corrections using below canopy ecosystem respiration estimates (Figure<a href="#fig:sigmaW" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:sigmaW">5</a>). Our assumption that photosynthesis under the canopy is zero is reasonable as there is no ground vegetation (except for occasional patches of moss) due to very little light penetrating the dense canopy. The values of the standard deviation of the wind speed above the canopy, <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{w_{top}}\)</span> used as a threshold for correcting <span class="math inline">\(NEE\)</span> were higher than those used by <span class="citation" data-cites="Jocher2017 Jocher2018">Jocher et al. (2017, 2018)</span> or <span class="citation" data-cites="Thomas2013">Thomas et al. (2013)</span> (0.33 and 0.45 <span class="math inline">\(\rm m\;s^{-1}\)</span>) but we believe not unrealistic. The small range of <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{w_{bottom}}\)</span> suggests very still wind conditions below the canopy as 95% of the wind speeds under the canopy were below 0.6 <span class="math inline">\(\rm m\;s^{-1}\)</span>(data not shown). The methodology proposed by <span class="citation" data-cites="Thomas2008">Thomas et al. (2008)</span> depends on identifying the threshold as the point where the linear relationship between <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{w_{bottom}}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{w_{top}}\)</span> breaks. The low range of <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{w_{bottom}}\)</span> resulted in only a small proportion of the data where there was a linear relationship between the bottom and top (Figure<a href="#fig:sigmaW" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:sigmaW">5</a>). Similar analysis with data from Forest Research’s broadleaf forest <span class="math inline">\(\rm CO_{2}\)</span> flux site in Hampshire <span class="citation" data-cites="Wilkinson2012">(Wilkinson et al. 2012)</span> showed <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{w_{bottom}}\)</span> in that stand was reaching values <span class="math inline">\(&gt;\)</span> 0.3 <span class="math inline">\(\rm m\;s^{-1}\)</span> and up to 1.0 <span class="math inline">\(\rm m\;s^{-1}\)</span> with a well-defined linear relationship between below- and above-canopy <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{w}\)</span>(Matthew Wilkinson, pers. communication) indicative of a more open and better coupled sub-canopy. We used a statistical method to minimise the sum of the root mean square error of the two linear regressions to calculate the <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{w_{top}}\)</span> threshold, which with the comparison with a well-coupled canopy increased our confidence that the applied corrections were justified. Uncorrected <span class="math inline">\(R_{e}\)</span> was closer to values reported by other studies which suggests possible canopy de-coupling effects may have been ignored. In our study, we found that ignoring this effect would have introduced an underestimation (more negative) of annual <span class="math inline">\(NEE\)</span> by 3.54 <span class="math inline">\(\rm tC\;ha^{-1}\;yr^{-1}\)</span>, introducing considerable bias in estimated annual carbon budgets. It is unknown if this error would propagate over the years at a constant rate or if it will vary in response to environmental conditions. We believe it is necessary for future flux monitoring studies to adopt measuring protocols for quantifying possible de-coupling effects. Furthermore, the use of process-based models and data assimilation techniques can quantify the long-term bias on annual budgets if such effects are unaccounted.</p>

Similarly, <span class="citation" data-cites="Grunwald2007">Grünwald and Bernhofer (2007)</span> found <span class="math inline">\(R_{e}\)</span> to range between 11.3 and 14.0 <span class="math inline">\(\rm tC\;ha^{-1}\;yr^{-1}\)</span> in a 118 year old Norway spruce stand; although that site had a similar mean air temperature (7.8 <span class="math inline">\(\rm ^{o}C\)</span>). Annual soil respiration rates measured in this study (5.6-7.6 <span class="math inline">\(\rm tC\;ha^{-1}\;yr^{-1}\)</span>) were similar to those reported by <span class="citation" data-cites="Zerva2005a">Zerva et al.

<p>There are two studies published assessing the carbon balance of clear-felled stands which are comparable to ours. <span class="citation" data-cites="Kowalski2004">Kowalski et al. (2004)</span> reported annual gross photosynthesis of 0.98 <span class="math inline">\(\rm tC\;ha^{-1}\;yr^{-1}\)</span> and ecosystem respiration of 11.0 <span class="math inline">\(\rm tC\;ha^{-1}\;yr^{-1}\)</span> for a site in Harwood Forest in the third year after clear-felling which resulted in a net <span class="math inline">\(\rm CO_{2}\)</span> source of 1.12 <span class="math inline">\(\rm tC\;ha^{-1}\;yr^{-1}\)</span>. In our clear-fell site the net source was very similar in 2017, the year of replanting, (0.97 <span class="math inline">\(\rm tC\;ha^{-1}\;yr^{-1}\)</span>) although only 2 years after felling, but the component fluxes, <span class="math inline">\(GPP\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(R_{e}\)</span>, were both much larger, (Table<a href="#tab:carbon_summary" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="tab:carbon_summary">[tab:carbon_summary]</a>). <span class="citation" data-cites="Paul-Limoges2015">Paul-Limoges et al. (2015)</span> also found high <span class="math inline">\(R_{e}\)</span> of 10.0 <span class="math inline">\(\rm tC\;ha^{-1}\;yr^{-1}\)</span>(similar to our 8.56 <span class="math inline">\(\rm tC\;ha^{-1}\;yr^{-1}\)</span>) in the first year after felling of a Canadian Douglas fir stand on a humic podzol <span class="math inline">\(\rm tC\;ha^{-1}\;yr^{-1}\)</span> where planting immediately followed felling. Measured soil respiration at the <span class="math inline">\(\rm CFS\)</span> was between 4.14 and 5.90 <span class="math inline">\(\rm tC\;ha^{-1}\;yr^{-1}\)</span> which is close to those previously reported for another clear-felled area in Harwood Forest <span class="citation" data-cites="Zerva2005a Zerva2005b">(Zerva et al. 2005; Zerva and Mencuccini 2005, 5.6 and 4.1 <span class="math inline">\(\rm tC\;ha^{-1}\;yr^{-1}\)</span>)</span>, but lower than those reported by <span class="citation" data-cites="Ball2007">Ball, Smith, and Moncrieff (2007, 7.1 and 6.5 <span class="math inline">\(\rm tC\;ha^{-1}\;yr^{-1}\)</span>)</span>.</p>
<p>There was a reduction in soil respiration in the first year after felling compared to the mature stand from 6.34 to 3.34 <span class="math inline">\(\rm tC\;ha^{-1}\;yr^{-1}\)</span>(Table<a href="#tab:carbon_summary" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="tab:carbon_summary">[tab:carbon_summary]</a>). The reduction presumably arises because of the change of respiration from both below-ground autotrophic and heterotrophic processes to largely heterotrophic as decomposition continues. Data from the <span class="math inline">\(\rm CFS\)</span> collected from 8 static dark chambers showed similar reduction in soil respiration <span class="citation" data-cites="Yamulki2020">(Yamulki et al. 2020)</span> while soil sampling found significantly reduced live root biomass 4 months after felling ended (Vanguelova 2020, personal communication).</p>
<p>Our results are in agreement with other studies <span class="citation" data-cites="Kowalski2004 Paul-Limoges2015 Korkiakoski2019">(Kowalski et al. 2004; Paul-Limoges et al. 2015; Korkiakoski et al. 2019)</span> in temperate and boreal conifer forests showing that clear-felling turns a forest stand from strong <span class="math inline">\(\rm CO_{2}\)</span> sink to a strong source. During the first year after felling the source was as large as the sink in the mature stand in 2015 in absolute terms (+7.05 versus -7.09 <span class="math inline">\(\rm tC\;ha^{-1}\;yr^{-1}\)</span> respectively, Table<a href="#tab:carbon_summary" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="tab:carbon_summary">[tab:carbon_summary]</a>). In British Columbia, <span class="citation" data-cites="Paul-Limoges2015">Paul-Limoges et al. (2015)</span> found that clear-felling Douglas fir stands doubled the <span class="math inline">\(\rm CO_{2}\)</span> source compared to the sink prior to felling, although the source strength varied between two clear-fellings. This difference is likely to be because Harwood Forest is cooler with wetter soil than the warmer, podzolic soil reported by <span class="citation" data-cites="Paul-Limoges2015">Paul-Limoges et al. (2015)</span>. In a southern Finland forest on a peat soil <span class="citation" data-cites="Korkiakoski2019">Korkiakoski et al. (2019)</span> showed a slightly higher source of carbon after clear-felling (8.42 <span class="math inline">\(\rm tC\;ha^{-1}\;yr^{-1}\)</span>) probably because of the higher organic carbon content of their peatland soil.</p>
<p>The strength of <span class="math inline">\(\rm CO_{2}\)</span> source in our clear-fell site was substantially reduced by in the second year to 3.06 <span class="math inline">\(\rm tC\;ha^{-1}\;yr^{-1}\)</span>. <span class="citation" data-cites="Paul-Limoges2015">Paul-Limoges et al. (2015)</span> found a similar strong reduction of 3 <span class="math inline">\(\rm tC\;ha^{-1}\;yr^{-1}\)</span>, and noted the recovery was due to the increase in existing ground vegetation. <span class="citation" data-cites="Korkiakoski2019">Korkiakoski et al. (2019)</span> found a recolonisation of ground vegetation in the second year which reduced the source by 32%, compared to our 52% reduction. This is not unreasonable because of two main factors. First, there will have been some underestimation of the first year source because of the temperature dependent gap-filling applied before measurements started in 2015 and second, organo-mineral soil is better drained than deep peats, which allows both ground vegetation growth and natural regeneration of spruce, hence the stronger uptake.</p>
<p>Despite the site being a strong <span class="math inline">\(\rm CO_{2}\)</span> source in the first year after felling there was substantial photosynthetic <span class="math inline">\(\rm CO_{2}\)</span> uptake (<span class="math inline">\(GPP\)</span>) because of the vigorous colonisation from grasses, sedges, herbs and mosses, as previously reported by <span class="citation" data-cites="Zerva2005b">Zerva and Mencuccini (2005)</span>. A survey conducted on the site in August 2015 (data not shown) found a large amount of <em>Juncus effusus</em>, and the mosses <em>Plagiothecium undulatum</em> and <em>Sphagnum</em> sp. in wetter parts, colonising the site only six months after felling with regenerating spruce seedlings appearing in the second year. <span class="citation" data-cites="Kirby1988">Kirby (1988)</span> found that after clear-felling of conifer plantations in previous lowland mixed deciduous woodlands the abundance and richness of grass species increased immediately.</p>
<h2 id="carbon-balance-of-clear-fell-phase">Carbon balance of clear-fell phase</h2>
<p>Standard forestry practice in Britain recommends planting should occur within two to three years after felling <span class="citation" data-cites="Murgatroyd2005">(Murgatroyd and Saunders 2005)</span> and the site was replanted in 2017, allowing further colonisation by ground vegetation and natural regeneration to increase photosynthesis during the second year (Table<a href="#tab:carbon_summary" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="tab:carbon_summary">[tab:carbon_summary]</a>). Gross primary production of the <span class="math inline">\(\rm CFS\)</span> in the year of planting was a third of that of the <span class="math inline">\(\rm MS\)</span>. <span class="citation" data-cites="Kowalski2004">Kowalski et al. (2004)</span> found their clear-fell Sitka spruce site had half the photosynthesis of a mature stand by the third year. However, both sites in the present study were more productive (Table<a href="#tab:carbon_summary" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="tab:carbon_summary">[tab:carbon_summary]</a>), and by the end of the third year the site was only a weak source (0.97 <span class="math inline">\(\rm tC\;ha^{-1}\;yr^{-1}\)</span>). It is also noteworthy that soil disturbance due to ground preparation and replanting was not enough to depress <span class="math inline">\(GPP\)</span> suggesting a strong contribution by the ground vegetation. In 2018 the spring-summer warm and dry conditions reduced water availability and increased respiration increasing the source again (see discussion on drought below). Comparing the overall impact of the clear-fell management on the carbon balance over the four years of measurements, the total net uptake by the mature stand was 29.38 <span class="math inline">\(\rm tC\;ha^{-1}\;yr^{-1}\)</span> while total losses from the felled site were 13.38 <span class="math inline">\(\rm tC\;ha^{-1}\;yr^{-1}\)</span> with a loss:gain ratio of 46% indicating that the rate of <span class="math inline">\(\rm CO_{2}\)</span> loss was almost half the carbon sequestered by the mature trees.</p>
<p>The time taken after afforestation for a site on organic or organo-mineral soil to act as a net <span class="math inline">\(\rm CO_{2}\)</span> sink in the UK has been estimated for low-to-medium productivity (yield class 6-10) Sitka spruce stands as up to 5 years <span class="citation" data-cites="Hargreaves2003">(Hargreaves, Milne, and Cannell 2003)</span> and on peaty-gley soil between 10 and 12 years <span class="citation" data-cites="Jarvis2007 Jarvis2009 Minunno2010">(Jarvis and Linder 2007; Jarvis et al. 2009; Minunno et al. 2010)</span>. These estimates were mainly based on limited <span class="math inline">\(\rm CO_{2}\)</span> flux data and model assumptions. In this study, we aimed to quantify the time for sink recovery from longer-term flux measurements. Both <span class="citation" data-cites="Hargreaves2003">Hargreaves, Milne, and Cannell (2003)</span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="Jarvis2009">Jarvis et al. (2009)</span> assumed a strong linear relationship of <span class="math inline">\(NEE\)</span> with years since felling, whereas modelling using the simplified light use efficiency model 3-PGN by <span class="citation" data-cites="Minunno2010">Minunno et al. (2010)</span> showed a more gradual recovery. For our study, using a linear relationship between <span class="math inline">\(NEE\)</span> and years since felling and ignoring the unusual drought year of 2018, the <span class="math inline">\(\rm CFS\)</span> would have turned into a sink of 2.4 <span class="math inline">\(\rm tC\;ha^{-1}\;yr^{-1}\)</span> four years after felling. However, our data suggest this recovery pattern is not linear, and if assuming a logarithmic relationship the site would turn into a smaller <span class="math inline">\(\rm CO_{2}\)</span> sink of 0.6 <span class="math inline">\(\rm tC\;ha^{-1}\;yr^{-1}\)</span> in four years. Whichever assumption is used we conclude that highly productive Sitka spruce stands (yield class 12-18) on similar peaty-gley soils will most likely be a net <span class="math inline">\(\rm CO_{2}\)</span> sink within five years post-felling, assuming losses due to dissolved or particulate organic carbon are negligible. In comparison, studies on Douglas fir forests found a sink recovery time of approximately 10 years <span class="citation" data-cites="Humphreys2006 Paul-Limoges2015">(Humphreys et al. 2006; Paul-Limoges et al. 2015)</span>. However, the carbon balance time course will depend on the ground vegetation present, the extent of regeneration, the delay before replanting, nutrient loss, degree of disturbance during replanting and will be susceptible to extreme weather events such as droughts, which as our study showed can extend the carbon sink recovery time. Moreover, common site preparation practices such as draining and mounding will have a significant impact on the balance of the other greenhouse gases, <span class="math inline">\(\rm CH_{4}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\rm N_{2}O\)</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="Mojeremane2012">(Mojeremane, Rees, and Mencuccini 2012)</span>. To further enrich our knowledge on how clear-felling affects upland plantation forestry, more studies are necessary on a range of different productivity stands managed under typical forest operations.</p>
<h2 id="the-impact-of-the-2018-drought-period">The impact of the 2018 drought period</h2>
<p>The impact of a drought on tree growth, carbon and energy exchange has been previously assessed for the European drought of 2003 <span class="citation" data-cites="Ciais2005 Grunwald2007 Wen2010">(Ciais et al. 2005; Grünwald and Bernhofer 2007; Wen et al. 2010)</span>. In 2018, forests across central and northern Europe again experienced an extreme heatwave and drought <span class="citation" data-cites="Bastos2020">(Bastos et al. 2020)</span>, and our measurements provide a new insight for a typical British Sitka spruce stand and associated clear-fell.</p>
<p>Whilst the soil of the mature stand was at field capacity at the start of 2018, as the year progressed soil water content declined due to a combination of reduced cloudiness and high solar radiation receipts (Figure<a href="#fig:meteorology" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:meteorology">1</a>) and reduced precipitation in May, June and July (Figure<a href="#fig:meteorology" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:meteorology">1</a>). Soil water content declined by June to lower levels than in previous years (Figure<a href="#fig:meteorology" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:meteorology">1</a>d) and did not return to pre-drought levels increasing the risk for carry-over impacts on photosynthesis and net carbon uptake in the subsequent years <span class="citation" data-cites="Aubinet2018">(Aubinet et al. 2018)</span>. During the heatwave, vapour pressure deficit increased, reducing photosynthesis (Figure<a href="#fig:carbon_water" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:carbon_water">[fig:carbon_water]</a>a and Table<a href="#tab:carbon_summary" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="tab:carbon_summary">[tab:carbon_summary]</a>) and water use efficiency (Figure<a href="#fig:carbon_water" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:carbon_water">[fig:carbon_water]</a>e). The unusually high temperatures increased ecosystem respiration and particularly above-ground respiration causing a 30% reduction in net <span class="math inline">\(\rm CO_{2}\)</span> uptake over the whole year (Table<a href="#tab:carbon_summary" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="tab:carbon_summary">[tab:carbon_summary]</a>). Our observations agree with a recent modelling study which suggested that the warmer spring in 2018 accelerated growth and evapotranspiration contributing to an earlier soil moisture depletion and amplifying the summer drought <span class="citation" data-cites="Bastos2020">(Bastos et al. 2020)</span>.</p>
<p>Other studies found similar levels of reduction in net <span class="math inline">\(\rm CO_{2}\)</span> uptake in mature spruce forest due to the 2003 drought <span class="citation" data-cites="Grunwald2007">(31%; Grünwald and Bernhofer 2007)</span>. The latter study also found a large increase in <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> during the 2003 drought doubling from approx. 0.6-0.7, while we found that during the drought more energy loss was by latent heat. We also found the drying soil affected the net radiation balance at the clear-fell as the exposed, drier soil surface (including a lot of needle litter) inhibited heat conduction and increased soil temperature (Figure<a href="#fig:meteorology" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:meteorology">1</a>b), leading to higher long-wave radiation loss, so that the day-time net radiation was lower than in the previous years, and the difference compared to the mature stand was more than could be accounted for by the difference in albedo.</p>
<p>The high temperatures, solar radiation and <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>(Figure<a href="#fig:meteorology" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:meteorology">1</a>) increased <span class="math inline">\(ET\)</span> substantially at both sites (Figure<a href="#fig:carbon_water" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:carbon_water">[fig:carbon_water]</a>d). Despite the reduction in <span class="math inline">\(ET\)</span> after soil water reached its lowest level, <span class="math inline">\(GPP\)</span> of the mature stand continued at high rates (Figure<a href="#fig:carbon_water" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:carbon_water">[fig:carbon_water]</a>a) only a little lower than in the same months in previous years. This suggests sufficient stomatal opening for photosynthesis despite the dry soil and high water loss rates (leading to low water use efficiency; Figure<a href="#fig:carbon_water" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:carbon_water">[fig:carbon_water]</a>e).</p>
<p>Drought inhibited the potential recovery of net <span class="math inline">\(\rm CO_{2}\)</span> uptake and prolonged the period that the clear-fell was a source (Table<a href="#tab:carbon_summary" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="tab:carbon_summary">[tab:carbon_summary]</a>). Although summer <span class="math inline">\(GPP\)</span> was slightly higher than the previous year, the annual <span class="math inline">\(GPP\)</span> total was similar. However, the warm and dry conditions reduced soil water (Figure<a href="#fig:meteorology" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:meteorology">1</a>d) and increased ecosystem respiration substantially, reducing net <span class="math inline">\(\rm CO_{2}\)</span> uptake. If drought causes substantial seedling losses after planting this will further compound the impact. Further investigation is necessary to assess drought tolerance of seedlings and the impact of droughts on the recovery of the <span class="math inline">\(\rm CO_{2}\)</span> sink.</p>
<h1 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h1>
<p>This study provides information on the impact of the clear-fell/replanting silvicultural system on carbon, energy and water fluxes and the impact of drought on them by answering these four key questions.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><em>How did clear-felling influence the <span class="math inline">\(\rm CO_{2}\)</span> source/sink dynamics in comparison to the closed-canopy stand?</em></p>
<p>Clear-felling an upland Sitka spruce stand on peaty-gley soil resulted in a strong annual <span class="math inline">\(\rm CO_{2}\)</span> emission (source) of similar magnitude to the net <span class="math inline">\(\rm CO_{2}\)</span> uptake (or sink) of a mature stand (-7.09 compared to 7.05 <span class="math inline">\(\rm tC\;yr^{-1}\)</span>). Growth of regenerating seedlings and ground vegetation reduced the source in the 2nd and 3rd years.</p></li>
<li><p><em>How was the site energy and water balance affected by felling?</em></p>
<p>The clear-felled area received less net radiation due to the higher albedo compared to the mature stand and had a warmer soil surface. The soil was wetter because of lower evapotranspiration from the ground surface, ground vegetation and seedlings. As vegetation recovered and new seedlings were established, more solar radiation was absorbed, and evapotranspiration increased.</p></li>
<li><p><em>How many years for the clear-fell area to turn from <span class="math inline">\(\rm CO_{2}\)</span> source to sink?</em></p>
<p>In the year of replanting, two years after felling, the clear-fell site changed from a strong source to a weak source (0.97 <span class="math inline">\(\rm tC\;ha^{-1}\;yr^{-1}\)</span>). Based on observed rates of net carbon uptake, similar sites on such organo-mineral soils will act as a sink within two years of planting if there is no impact of a drought.</p></li>
<li><p><em>How did drought affect the sink/source dynamics for carbon, water, and energy at the two sites?</em></p>
<p>The exceptionally warm and dry conditions of spring and summer 2018 reduced annual net carbon uptake of the mature stand by 30% compared to previous 3 years, through a small (5%) reduction in annual <span class="math inline">\(GPP\)</span>, and a small (8%) increase in <span class="math inline">\(R_{e}\)</span>. There was a large increase (28%) in <span class="math inline">\(R_{e}\)</span> at the clear-fell site, which reduced the clear-fell site’s return towards being an annual net <span class="math inline">\(\rm CO_{2}\)</span> sink. Evapotranspiration increased by 69% and 36%, from the mature stand and clear-fell sites, respectively.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Our results highlight the impact of clear-felling in Sitka spruce plantations on organo-mineral soils and have concentrated on the first few years post-harvest. Additional investigation is required to elucidate what is the short-term (e.g., weeks) impact of clear-felling on fluxes and if there is a large immediate pulse of <span class="math inline">\(\rm CO_{2}\)</span>, or other GHGs. More frequent and higher intensity drought will likely cause more carbon release from such clear-fell sites, limit vegetation growth and increase tree seedling mortality. Research is needed on lower-impact silvicultural management practices that may mitigate these issues.</p>
