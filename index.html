	  <h3> Ecophysiological research</h3>
	  <p> Web pages to demonstrate some of the ecophysiological research currently running at Forest Research. 
	  The links show the results from measurements from our conifer flux site at Harwood Forest (no longer operational) 
	  and a greenhouse control drought experiment.  </p>

    <h2>Key publications</h2>
    <h3>Soil-Plant-Atmosphere Continuum Hydraulic Efficiency</h3>
    <p>This is a new methodology for monitoring water deficit from continuous measurements and at different scales. The method is based on the Electric Circuit Theory. You can find more details in the preprint (currently submitted in New Phytologist). </p>
    <p><strong><a href="https://doi.org/10.31223/X54T19">Xenakis, G., 2023. Electric Circuit Theory as a method for monitoring tree water deficit at different scales. EarthArXiv Preprint, https://doi.org/10.31223/X54T19</a></strong></p>
    <p>There is also an Rshiny app demonstrating the application of the new methdology as an index of tree water deficit. Click on the link for the <strong><a href="https://drgeorgexenakis.shinyapps.io/TreeWD/">TWDM (Tree Water Deficit Monitoring)</a></strong> app.</p>
	  <h3>Harwood Forest flux site</h3>
	  <p> We run two flux sites at Harwood Forest, Northumberland. One mature (no longer operation) and one young (planted in 2017). 
	  You can find a detailed description of the site, measurements and results in the link below
